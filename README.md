# jRAT Controller API
API for developing controller-side plugins for jRAT
## How to start using it
You need to add it as a library in your IDE. You do not need to include the API in the plugin, jRAT will already have it loaded
## Structure
Both your Controller and Stub plugin need a plugin.txt file in the root that will contain the main class name (like se.jrat.MainClass)
